Answer the given questions:

a. Utilize the appropriate index command to extract 'a' from the string 'great,' where s = 'great.' The expected output is 'a.'

b. Develop a program to determine the second smallest number in the provided list: li = [32, 3, 5, 8, 33, 7]. The expected output is 5.

c. Identify the unique values within the list: mylist = [1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 6, 11, 11]. The expected output is [1, 5, 3, 6, 11].

d. Create a program to calculate and print the cube root of 216 using the appropriate syntax. The expected output is 6.

Replace the occurrence of 'hello' in the nested list a = [1, 2, [3, 4, 'hello']] with 'bye.' The expected output is [1, 2, [3, 4, 'bye']].

Given the dictionary: dict = {'a': 9, 'b': (2, 3, 1), 'c': ['object0', 'object1', 'object2']}, write a program that returns ['object0'] as the output.

Develop a program to calculate the area of a circle. The program should prompt the user to enter the radius, and it should then print the computed area.

Input text: "Please enter the radius of the circle."
If the user enters a value of 5, the output should be: "The area of the circle is 78.54."
The program should handle invalid input, notifying the user to enter a number if a character is provided.
Create a program that takes two input lists, X and Y, and returns a list containing all the odd numbers present in both lists. Common elements can be repeated.

Input lists: X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and Y = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
Expected output: [1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9] or [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] (both accepted).
Write a function that prints integers from 1 to 15. For multiples of three, print "GREAT" instead of the number; for multiples of five, print "LEARNING." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "GREATLEARNING."

Dataset: Online_sales.csv
Domain: Retail
Objective: Analyzing sales data to understand sales trend

1. Begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading the provided dataset, online_sales.csv. Once loaded, inspect the top 5 and randomly select 5 samples from the dataframe.

2. Examine the information about the dataframe, detailing your observations. Pay close attention to data types and the overall shape of the dataset.

3. Investigate and identify any null values present in the dataset. Report the percentage of null values for each column and subsequently remove rows containing null values.

4. Analyze the statistical summary of the dataset using appropriate inbuilt functions.

5. Eliminate instances in the dataset where the quantity is less than zero. Note that this action should be based on the 'Quantity' feature.

6. Explore the unique values within the 'Country' column and identify the country with the highest number of instances or rows.

7. Introduce a new column named 'sales,' calculated as the product of Quantity and UnitPrice, representing the total sales.

8. Evaluate and report the top 5 countries based on sales, considering both the size and mean value of sales.

9. Identify and report the top 5 products that contribute the most to sales, using the StockCode for product information.

10. Convert the 'InvoiceDate' column into a date format and determine the month in which the maximum sales occur. Provide insights based on this analysis.

Project********About Project- Tourist Place Generator app*******************
<br>
<br>
Tourist Place generator is a small LLM based project where an application is created using chatgpt and framworks  like streamlit , langchain  etc.
<br>
This project requires a country name that suggests the tourist places in that state of the desired country.

Project:*********Retail Marketing exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing*****************
<br>
Course: Programming with Python
<br>
<br>
The project is based on exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing methods to understand the marketing campaigns and their outcomes. It involves making use of univariate and bivariate analysis, visualization methods, garbage value treatment, and data manipulation methods to answer queries related to cosumer's purchasing pattern and prepare a report for the management team.
