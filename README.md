Answer the given questions:

a. Utilize the appropriate index command to extract 'a' from the string 'great,' where s = 'great.' The expected output is 'a.'

b. Develop a program to determine the second smallest number in the provided list: li = [32, 3, 5, 8, 33, 7]. The expected output is 5.

c. Identify the unique values within the list: mylist = [1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 6, 11, 11]. The expected output is [1, 5, 3, 6, 11].

d. Create a program to calculate and print the cube root of 216 using the appropriate syntax. The expected output is 6.

Replace the occurrence of 'hello' in the nested list a = [1, 2, [3, 4, 'hello']] with 'bye.' The expected output is [1, 2, [3, 4, 'bye']].

Given the dictionary: dict = {'a': 9, 'b': (2, 3, 1), 'c': ['object0', 'object1', 'object2']}, write a program that returns ['object0'] as the output.

Develop a program to calculate the area of a circle. The program should prompt the user to enter the radius, and it should then print the computed area.

Input text: "Please enter the radius of the circle."
If the user enters a value of 5, the output should be: "The area of the circle is 78.54."
The program should handle invalid input, notifying the user to enter a number if a character is provided.
Create a program that takes two input lists, X and Y, and returns a list containing all the odd numbers present in both lists. Common elements can be repeated.

Input lists: X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and Y = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
Expected output: [1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9] or [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] (both accepted).
Write a function that prints integers from 1 to 15. For multiples of three, print "GREAT" instead of the number; for multiples of five, print "LEARNING." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "GREATLEARNING."

Project : Music Player system
<br>
Description: We have chosen to mimic a music player system. To keep the
scope minimum we are not going to actually play any music, rather focus will be to build an
application that should exhibit the similar behavior. Users will be allowed to create multiple
playlists based on their mood. Users can pick songs from any of the created playlist and will be
allowed to play the music file they have chosen.

Project : Power Grid System
<br>
Description: We have taken a scenario of a power grid system and electricity
distribution to the houses attached with these power grids. Every power grid has power supply
nodes/propagators that are providing power to different areas and localities more precisely to
different houses.
Let's assume that there is a list of propagators from P1
to Pn, Each of these propagators are
further connected with each other and different houses to provide the power. As we know that
every power grid has its own capacity and providing power more than its capacity is not
possible. Similarly each of the propagators comes with their own limitation and should not
exhaust the assigned power limit. Each of the propagators may be connected with the H1
to Hk to provide the power supply.

Project: Divide and conquer
<br>
Description: Consulting for an IoT firm. The firm has placed multiple sensor devices in an
organization where data is being collected at a rapid rate.
The IoT firm has designed a master-slave architecture where multiple sensors are responding to
a single master node. It means that even though these devices have different ID and storage
capacity, all the data collected by them is going to a specific master node. The master node can
be considered as a simple raspberry pi device. All the sensors that are forwarding data to a
particular raspberry pi will have its information stored for the data forwarding.
In the beginning the firm has not planned for load balancing. As the number of sensors/devices
increased and the firm engineers kept on assigning the devices to a master/raspberry pi based
on the maximum capacity, it created a unique problem where some of the raspberry pi or master
nodes are overloaded and some of them are under loaded.

Project: Graph based Problem
<br>
Description: Consider a rectangular city (let’s say star_city) partitioned into a grid of square cells as shown in the image.Each of the borders of the star_city are surrounded by different cities- Greendale at top, Smallville at right, Duckburg at bottom and Blue Valley at left.
Each square cell represents the altitude of the land area (1 lowest and 10 highest).
A person can climb down from a higher altitude area to a lower altitude area. So, a person from a particular cell can reach to its adjacent cell (up, left, right, bottom) only if the adjacent cell is of equal or lower altitude.
Also, all the cells on the border are connected to the respective border city. That means a person can reach a particular neighboring city from any of the cells lying on the border for that city.
We have to find-
1.	Any 1 route (if exists) from the cell marked Source to the cell marked Destination. 
2.	Any 1 route (if exists) from Blue Valley to Smallville

Capstone Project: Food object image classification
<br>

Food picture categorization is a major computer vision challenge with applications ranging from automated food business services to dietary monitoring and food recommendation systems. In order to increase the precision of food image categorization, this study investigates three different approaches: a basic CNN ensemble, an ensemble of pretrained VGG16 models, and a single pretrained VGG16 model. The dataset used in the study is made up of food photos that have been divided into training and testing subsets and classified into 17 different groups. The first method, which used a basic CNN ensemble, showed only modest success in classifying and extracting features. The second method produced better results by combining features from different models and using transfer learning to create an ensemble of pretrained VGG16 models. Out of all the strategies examined, the third and final strategy had the highest classification accuracy since it only used one pretrained VGG16 model. Extensive pretraining on a large-scale dataset improved this model's performance overall and its ability to extract features. The study illustrates the benefits of pretrained models for challenging picture classification problems and shows how sophisticated architectures can significantly improve accuracy. These findings imply that performance in food picture classification applications can be greatly enhanced by utilizing transfer learning and adding pretrained models.
